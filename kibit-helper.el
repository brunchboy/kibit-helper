;;; Commentary:

;; Provides functions that make it easy to work with the Kibit
;; Leiningen plugin for detecting and improving non-idiomatic
;; Clojure source code, from within GNU Emacs. See
;; <https://github.com/jonase/kibit> for more information about
;; Kibit.

;; This package does not require Cider, although if you are working
;; with Clojure in Emacs, you should almost certaily be using it.
;; <http://www.github.com/clojure-emacs/cider>

;;; Installation:

;; Available as a package in melpa.org

;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
;;
;; M-x package-install kibit-helper

;;; Usage:

;; M-x kibit
;; M-x kibit-current-file
;; M-x kibit-accept-proposed-change

;; You will likely want to bind the last function to C-x C-`
;; so it is easy to alternate with the next-error function
;; (conventionally C-x `) as you walk through the suggestions
;; made by Kibit:

;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-`") 'kibit-accept-proposed-change)

;; Note that some changes cannot be automatically applied.
;; Kibit strips comments from the source code, and so they
;; will be missing from both the "original" and suggested
;; versions of the code being examined. You will need to
;; manually apply these changes, and kibit-accept-proposed-change
;; will tell you when that happens. It will also tell you if
;; you seem to be running it twice on the same change, i.e.
;; the suggested improvements have already been made.
